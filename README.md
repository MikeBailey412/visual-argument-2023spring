 My project is an ad for the band Linkin Park's latest single release, "Lost." I want to focus on how we as humans go through hardships in life and how life can be challenging in general. A lot of their music talks about dealing with life, the pain we experience, and bottling up our emotions. I think that if some people give their music a listen, it could really benefit them due to the messages expressed in their music, especially if that said person is going through a tough time in their life.
