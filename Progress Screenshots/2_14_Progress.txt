In this preview I'm showing the progress that I've made so far on my visual argument project.  As of right now, I found a good background that I think fits the mood I'm going for.  It's a picture of the lead singer of Linkin Park, Chester Bennington singing to a crowd in a stadium.  I thought this was a really good fit for my project because the song only includes vocals from Chester, and he unfortunately passed away around six years ago.  It shows how all of the fans adored him and looked up to him.  I think the fact that all the fans have their flashes on adds to the tone I'm looking for as well.  I added a focus blur effect over this picture that is centered on Chester because I wanted him to stand out more over the crowd.  I added the blur effect in the first place because I want the main focus to be the words I included on the canvas.  I’ve added in small letters, “Sometimes we feel” near the top of the canvas because I want the main focus in the center of the canvas to be the word, “Lost” in big bold letters.  This is because the finished product will be an ad for the band’s newest single, “Lost.”  My idea is to put three of the band’s well known albums into three of the letters, and then finally the cover art for the song, “Lost” in the fourth letter.  How I’m going to order them is still up in the air.   I’ll also add some shadows to the back of the letters to make them pop even more than they already do.  I included one of Linkin Park’s logos in the bottom left to make it seem like more of an advertisement for the band.  It is black so it kind of blends in with the background as to not draw attention away from the focal points I intend on.
